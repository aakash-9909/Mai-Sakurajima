# Project Title: A date with Mai- Sakurajima)
# This file does have other girls but its mainly about her....
# Ignore this doctstring( i have only explained my idea of what i wanted to make) and read the main functions if you want


"""
So heres the basic idea of this project, i am quite flexible with this project so i will accept suggestion from
everyone, including freinds and families...

Main character:- Mai Sakurajima, Alya(Alisa Mikhailovna Kujou), Neuro Sama(The Ai Vtuber)
(i will be adding their backgrounds a bit, from google offc)


// Its a kinda a dating sim we will be visiting various places together, i will maybe llink my yt channel edits to them if possible
Ok games may include Mai Sakurajima -> Restraurant(Tomoe koga will be there and some jokes too), some library to make visual waiter say things
                                        like cowsay
                                        somehow output the bill
                                        insert futaba on phone call somewhere so maybe a fake calling device
                                        dinner(maybe kaede here)
                                        car somehting like cowsay again (nokoda toyahama here)

                    Mai-> Toyclaw Machine
                    Venidng Machine
                    end with an image output of mai san


        Alya :- Studdy session?
                Restraurant again the chilly one

        for neuro the basic guessing game i wanted to genreally copy paste some ai output from some opensource ai but that seems quite complicated
        rn so lets leave it at that



#some PiP
cowsay , pyfiglet, pillow, random, open ai , time.sleep,
